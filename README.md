### About the Experiment 

Objective of 4 bit Booth's Multiplier:

1. Understanding behaviour of Booth's multiplication algorithm from working module and the module designed by the student as part of the experiment
2. Designing Booth's multiplier with a controller and a datapath. This will also help in the learning of control unit design as a finite state machine
3. Understanding the advantages of Booth's multiplier
    - It can handle signed integers in 2's complement notion
    - It decreases the number of addition and subtraction
    - It requires less hardware than combinational multiplier
    - It is faster than straightforward sequential multiplier
